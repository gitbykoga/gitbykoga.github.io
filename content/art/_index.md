I started drawing when I was around 8. Since then, I've been drawing daily/weekly, exploring different styles, materials, and techniques. In 2020, I bought a Wacom tablet, downloaded Krita, and began learning digital art. I also started uploading my art in my [<span class="link">instagram account</link>](https://www.instagram.com/by.koga).

In this section, I'll be sharing everything I've learned in the last years, including tips & tricks, useful links, and content about my art journey.
