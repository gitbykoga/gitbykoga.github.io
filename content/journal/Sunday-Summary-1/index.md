# Games

This week I spent quite a lot of time working on this mini project called Numerus! I'm very proud of how fast I managed to complete the demo, considering it took the time I was expecting it to take (which is very rare, usually).

### What is it about?

It is basically a "game" that started with the idea of practicing <ins>await async architecture</ins>. Therefore, I didn't care about the game itself, but more about learning. And I did indeed learn a lot! Not only that, this project turned out as a very interesting neat tool. I created an apk version, which means I can just open it whenever I want to check facts about numbers (surprisingly more useful than you might think initially)

It shows if the number is a prime, if it is a Fibonacci number (the famous 0 1 1 2 3 5 8... sequence), its factorization, and some other things. I intend on increasing the amount of widgets it has, cus then that's when it gets to the *fun part*

Anyways, I think I'm done with this project, so I'll be moving to other things! In case you're interested, here is the link:

# Art

I worked on two specific pieces that are part of my new routine:

<div class="is-flex is-justify-content-center">
<div class="mx-3">
{{< imgproc path="images/new.png" method="Fit" size="400x400" >}}
</div>
<div class="mx-3">
{{< imgproc path="images/night.png" method="Fit" size="400x400" >}}
</div>
</div>

<br>

The first one has the kanji for "New", and the second one has the kanji for "Night". I think this makes my art feel more cohesive overall, even if I eventually change my style quite drastically. <span class="marked mode-none">The kanji help unite my work, if that makes sense.</span>

Therefore, I intend on drawing more and more pieces with kanji as overlay. Let's see how it goes! I'll eventually put the kanji for my family's name as well:

> # 「古賀」 - Koga

# Design

This week I started working as the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) of the newly created startup of my sister - [dupla.tech](https://www.dupla.tech). Bear in mind, it is still very early, so the website might not be working.
Anyway, I am currently taking care of the branding: designing the website, our logo, stationary, etc. Take a look!

These are all of the logo variations. Neat right? There is some other stuff, in case you're interested. Here is the link for the medias!

# Conclusion

Wow! This week was very productive, *ngl*. I managed to work a bit on each of the main sections of my website (art, games, design, journal). I intend on writing some new posts about Numerus, dupla.tech, and my drawings later. After all, currently the other sections are a bit too empty for my liking
