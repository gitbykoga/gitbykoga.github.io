# I won't give up

So, yesterday I had a blast. And no, it wasn't anything truly exciting, considering how we now live stuck inside our homes while the news only talk about the daily dead count... *positive vibes only*.

I played Overwatch[^1] with three other friends for what seemed like two hours, but was actually... **6 hours**. Yeah, considering how I wanted to maintain a great morning routine, this wasn't great. Anyways, although I had originally planed to take care of all my ["Social Experiment Tasks"](https://bykoga.com/journal/updates-1/) in the morning, I wasn't about to give up my beautiful speech about persistence after one single day.

Here I am now, 5pm, finishing my tasks. *Trust me, it wasn't so bad*. I drew one more artwork, created one more Scribbled Guide, posted my daily Reddit thing, and am now finishing this. Honestly, after you start the process, it is easier to keep going.

> I'll keep this post as an incentive for me to stop slacking off

There's not much else to say, honestly. I'll see how it goes in the weekends
