# Introduction
As any developer that is starting their journey, my first finished program was called 'Hello-World' (I don't remember the language I used, but I think it was Ruby). It is part of the programming culture, and a very cool one at that, as it reunites programmers from all levels of experience.

Similarly, this is the first post of my self-made, self-coded, and self-designed website called byKOGA. I've been programming for several years, and I started learning about web focused tech in 2018. I started trying to create custom themes for my previous WordPress website called thethoughtcompiler.com[^1].

Didn't take long for me to get the hang of the languages, and after some few months I helped a Brazilian NGO rebrand their <a href="https://www.noic.com.br" class="link" target="_blank">website</a> (you can check my name in the footer of the page). I became their vice-president as well, although nowadays I only help with tech related issues.

### Framework and tools
After realizing that I valued speed over flexibility, I decided to look for different ways of developing a website. After finding out about <a href="https://gohugo.io" class="link" target="_blank">Hugo</a> - self-proclaimed fastest website framework in the world - I fell in love with the simplicity and developer focused style of the tool.

Together with Github Pages and Google Domains, I had the perfect combo for creating a fast and relatively cheap website for my needs. Around a few months later, byKOGA was oficially created.

# But, why?
I've always liked the idea of having my own website to share about my hobbies and "internet adventures"; not because I need validation, but just because I feel I could help others that are currently going through things that I had to learn and deal with by myself. I certainly feel very proud of being self-taught in pretty much everything that I know nowadays, but <span class="marked mode-none">I unfortunately also spent a lot, **(a lot!)** of time banging my head against the wall</span> trying to learn all sorts of things. Furthermore, I feel like I am a fast learner, so why not use it to help others?

# My plans
<span class="is-size-7" style="color: gray">~~Ah, I can't wait to look at this in a few months and laugh at myself~~</span>

Weeell, considering this is a project that took months to conclude, I obviously have a lot of expectations and things planned, such as:
1. Properly organize my social medias, in such a way that I slowly grow my brand[^2]
2. Hopefully be able to post new content every week in this website (or, at least, every two weeks)
3. Get some decent views and engagement. Who knows?

### Conclusion
If everything works out properly (which would be a miracle), then this website might have a lot of potential. However, it's important to not set my expectations too high. Furthermore, my main goal here is to share my thoughts and hopefully help some people along the way.

If you're interested, or if some of my latter posts did indeed help you, I'd appreciate if you showed support - any type, really. Things such as following me on my social medias, commenting, etc., are greatly appreciated!

Constructive criticism is welcomed as well. If you want to send an email, just click <a href="/#contact" class="link">here</a>

Thanks for reading this short post, and have a nice day!
