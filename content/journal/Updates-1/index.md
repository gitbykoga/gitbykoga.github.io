# Persistence is the key
Today, I realized how far a person can go by simply not giving up;
We don't need miraculous effort, skill, nor brilliancy, to achieve what we want.

> All it takes is a bit of luck and endless persistence

It might seem obvious, but it isn't.
It all started with my sister sharing an [Instagram art account](https://www.instagram.com/jaepak.md) she liked

**Jaepak, the mentioned artist, attracted hundreds of thousands of people in <ins>one year</ins>. How?**

It is all about his effort. I'm not saying his art is bad. It isn't. But the fact that he posted 900 drawings since the start of 2020 (on average two posts per day) tells a lot.

All he needed was appealing colors and this clear discipline, which most people don't have.

> <span class="marked mode-none">It is easy to say "just don't give up", but the fact that almost everyone gives up tells a lot.</span>

After thinking a lot about this, I decided to change my mentality: **Quality isn't necessarily better than quantity**. Ideally, we would all like to have both. However, I've always thought that, if I had to choose, that I should **always** favor quality.

What I didn't realize is that to reach that level of quality, I had to start somewhere. By being afraid of trying and starting slow, I would always upload inconsistently, whether it was art, games, etc.

But now, I'm doing this social experiment. I'll post daily (art, game dev, etc.), for how many days I decide it is worth until I find the answer: <ins>Is it truly all about persistence?</ins>

Wish me luck.

# Morning Routines are great

#### I thought: Why not share a bit of how my ideal morning is? Let's start:

1. I wake up around 7:45 to 8:05
2. I then eat breakfast, make some coffee, and go upstairs, back to my bedroom
3. I meditate for 10 minutes, while I wait for my coffee to hit the right temperature
4. After meditating, I do some exercising or stretching while drinking my dirty beans
* At this point, it is 9:00 more or less
5. I then go to my computer, and start my daily (branding / drawing / other things) routine
6. I start by drawing for 2 hours more or less. The drawing is then uploaded to Instagram at 11:00
7. After that, I create my daily Scribbled Guide, a series I started on Twitter in which I post daily guides related to game dev. This takes around half an hour
* At this point, it is 11:30
8. Then I go to Reddit and post something quick, either on r/art, r/gamedevscreens, r/overwatch, or r/web-design (prone to changes). This takes around 15 minutes
9. Finally, I write my daily update, just like this one. This takes 30 extra minutes.
* Considering extra time spent posting stuff, and some other variables, I finish this routine between 12:00 to 13:00

That is it! All it takes for me to start the day and upload a drawing on Instagram, a guide on Twitter, and new content on Reddit, is four hours. You might think: Why so much time spent on social medias? Well, it's complicated...

# half•alive

I love the Spotify embed (except that it makes my ears bleed. *Why, oh god why, they can't add a volume bar?*), so I decided to share this new song from half•alive which **just bops**

Here it is! <span class="marked mode-none">**CAREFUL THIS MIGHT BE VERY LOUD**</span>

<div class="columns">
<iframe class="column" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1C5YO3ItmCjO2lUtLQmYYO" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<iframe class="column" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/48XkVAagIoQHCsOlJtXUd5" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

</div>

I also put two of their old songs. It is insane how much they've changed!

Here are the Spotify links in case you don't want to make your ears bleed:
* [What's Wrong](https://open.spotify.com/track/1C5YO3ItmCjO2lUtLQmYYO?si=dcd81314d6424c78)
* [still feel.](https://open.spotify.com/track/48XkVAagIoQHCsOlJtXUd5?si=93af0f0cb24f4264)
