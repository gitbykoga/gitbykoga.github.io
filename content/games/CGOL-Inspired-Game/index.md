# How little squares come to life
Currently creating a game called Seagull[^1]. Inspired by Conway's Game of Life, the invention of the famous mathematician that, among many things, had a talent for turning math into interactive pieces of art. By defining simple rules, he managed to create a game that, although zero-player, certainly had the power to interest many, many players and mathematicians alike. If you're interested in what I'm talking about, check these two amazing videos by Sam Hogan and Alan Zucconi

### Taking notes
After reading the news that Conway had passed away due to COVID related problems, I couldn't help but wonder. Was there any way to keep his legacy going, but with a breath of fresh air? Considering it is a zero-player game, if I wanted to create, you know... a *playable* game out of it, something would have to change. It was the natural path to think... <ins>what if I just let the player control the initial variables?</ins> Perhaps a little like the game from Rovio, Bad Piggies, where you create vehicles to help you achieve certain objectives. The core idea is that you can't control the vehicle after you hit play, just like my game <span class="is-size-7" style="color: gray">(yes this was the first game that came to mind, idk)</span>

# Plans
Basically, my current plan is to create the MVP until the end of April (I think I can finish it before, but it's better not to get my hopes up too much). What is missing for the MVP:
* Better UI for things like the inventory
* Level selector
* A winning condition <span class="is-size-7" style="color:gray">(ironic, but listen me out --- I know how it will be, I just need to code it)</span>

After I finish it, if I see some potential, I might create my Steam Page and start investing in it more heavily. Let's see how it goes. Also, if you're interested in creating your own Steam page the right way, here's another great video:
